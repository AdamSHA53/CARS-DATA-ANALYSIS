# CARS-DATA-ANALYSIS


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Indian cars sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides information about various car models, manufacturers, basic features, and considerations to buy. The analysis aims to gain insights into the Indian automotive market and provide valuable information for car enthusiasts, manufacturers, and consumers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- `Model`: Name of the car model.
- `Manufacturer`: Manufacturer of the car.
- `Mileage`: Mileage of the car (in kilometers per liter).
- `Engine`: Engine capacity of the car (in cc).
- `Power`: Power output of the car (in bhp).
- `Seats`: Number of seats in the car.
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used by the car.
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (Automatic/Manual).
- 'Dimensions' : Length,Breadth and width of the car

## Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing any missing or duplicate values, and correcting data types if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the distribution and relationships between variables, identifying trends and patterns.
3. Statistical Analysis: Calculating summary statistics, correlation coefficients, and conducting hypothesis testing if applicable.
4. Visualization: Creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the data.
5. Insights: Drawing conclusions and providing insights based on the analysis findings.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anushabellam/cars-cars-2) and save it as `indian_cars.csv`.
2. Open the Excel file containing the dataset using Microsoft Excel or any compatible software.
